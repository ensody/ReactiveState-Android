# ReactiveState for Kotlin and Android

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.ensody.reactivestate/reactivestate/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.ensody.reactivestate/reactivestate)

An easy to understand reactive state management solution for Kotlin Multiplatform and Android.

ReactiveState-Kotlin provides you with these foundations:

* multiplatform: share your ViewModels and reactive state handling logic between all platforms
* reactive programming: everything is recomputed/updated automatically based on straightforward code
* demand-driven programming: resource-consuming computations and values are allocated on-demand and disposed when not needed
* event handling: simple events based on interfaces (more composable and less boilerplate than sealed classes)
* automatic error handling: no more forgotten try-catch or copy-pasted error handling logic all over the place
* automatic cleanup/dispose logic (e.g. dispose something once a `CoroutineScope` is canceled)
* coroutine-based unit tests: worry no more about passing around `CoroutineDispatcher`s everywhere
* lifecycle handling (esp. Android)
* state restoration (esp. Android)

This library is split into separate modules for Kotlin (`core` and `core-test`) and Android (`reactivestate`).

## Installation

Add the package to your `build.gradle`'s `dependencies {}`:

```groovy
dependencies {
    // Add the BOM using the desired ReactiveState version
    api platform("com.ensody.reactivestate:reactivestate-bom:VERSION")

    // Now you can leave out the version number from all other ReactiveState modules:
    implementation "com.ensody.reactivestate:reactivestate" // For Kotlin projects

    implementation "com.ensody.reactivestate:reactivestate-test" // Utils for unit tests that want to use coroutines
    // Note: kotlin-coroutines-test only supports the "jvm" target, so reactivestate-test has the same limitation
}
```

Also, make sure you've integrated the Maven Central repo, e.g. in your root `build.gradle`:

```groovy
subprojects {
    repositories {
        // ...
        mavenCentral()
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Use-cases

### Keeping UI in sync with state

```kotlin
class MainViewModel : ViewModel() {
    // You can also use MutableLiveData, but then you'll have to deal with null.
    val name = MutableStateFlow("")
    val counter = MutableStateFlow(0)

    // This is automatically recomputed whenever counter's value is changed
    val doubledCounter: StateFlow<Int> = derived { 2 * get(counter) }

    // This is only computed while someone is subscribed to changes (autoRun, derived or collect)
    val onDemandDoubledCounter = derived(initial = 0, started = WhileSubscribed()) { 2 * get(counter) }

    fun increment() {
        counter.value += 1
    }
}

class MainFragment : Fragment() {
    private val viewModel by viewModels<MainViewModel>()

    override fun onCreateView(
        inflater: LayoutInflater, container: ViewGroup?,
        savedInstanceState: Bundle?
    ): View {
        // ...
        // val nameInputField = ...
        // val incrementButton = ...

        nameInputField.addTextChangedListener {
            viewModel.name.value = nameInputField.text.toString()
        }

        autoRun {
            // get() returns the StateFlow.value (or LiveData.value) and tells autoRun to re-execute
            // this code block whenever model.name or model.counter is changed.
            // Result: isEnabled changes while you type.
            incrementButton.isEnabled = get(viewModel.name).isNotEmpty() && get(viewModel.doubledCounter) < 100
        }

        incrementButton.setOnClickListener {
            viewModel.increment()
        }

        // ...
    }
}
```

With `autoRun` (available on `LifecycleOwner`, `ViewModel`, `CoroutineScope`, etc.) you can observe and re-execute a function whenever any of the `StateFlow` or `LiveData` instances accessed by that function are modified.
On Android you can use this to keeping the UI in sync with your ViewModel. Of course, you can also keep non-UI state in sync.
Depending on the context in which `autoRun` is executed, this observer is automatically tied to a `CoroutineScope` (e.g. the `ViewModel`'s `viewModelScope`) or in case of a `Fragment`/`Activity` to the `onStart()`/`onStop()` lifecycle in order to prevent accidental crashes and unnecessary resource consumption.

With `derived` you can construct new `StateFlow`s based on the `autoRun` principle. You can control when the calculation should run by passing `Eagerly`, `Lazily` or `WhileSubscribed()`, for example. Especially `WhileSubscribed()` is important for expensive computations.

Note that `autoRun` can be extended to support observables other than `StateFlow`, `LiveData` and `WhileUsed` (see below).

### Correct lifecycle handling

```kotlin
interface MainEvents {
    fun showMessage(message: String)
}

class MainViewModel : ViewModel() {
    // This queue can be used to send events to the MainEvents in the STARTED lifecycle state.
    // Instead of boilerplaty event sealed classes we use a simple MainEvents interface with methods.
    val eventNotifier = EventNotifier<MainEvents>()

    fun someAction() {
        viewModelScope.launch {
            val result = api.requestSomeAction()

            // Switch back to MainFragment (the latest visible instance).
            eventNotifier {
                // If the screen got rotated in the meantime, `this` would point
                // to the new MainFragment instance instead of the destroyed one
                // that did the initial `someAction` call above.
                showMessage(result.someMessage)
            }
        }
    }
}

class MainFragment : Fragment(), MainEvents {
    private val viewModel: MainViewModel by viewModels()

    init {
        // Execute the MainViewModel's events in the >=STARTED state to prevent crashes
        lifecycleScope.launchWhenStarted {
            viewModel.eventNotifier.collect { it() }
        }
    }

    // ...

    override fun onCreateView(
        inflater: LayoutInflater, container: ViewGroup?,
        savedInstanceState: Bundle?
    ): View {
        // ...
        // val button = ...

        button.setOnClickListener {
            viewModel.someAction()
        }

        // ...
    }

    fun showMessage(message: String) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

On Android, managing operations independently of the UI lifecycle (e.g. button click -> request -> UI rotated -> response -> UI update/navigation) is made unnecessarily difficult because Android can destroy your UI in the middle of an operation.
To work around this, you'll usually launch a coroutine in `ViewModel.viewModelScope` and/or use a `Channel` to communicate between the `ViewModel` and the UI.

In order to simplify this pattern, ReactiveState provides `EventNotifier` and the lower-level `MutableFlow` (which has buffered, exactly-once consumption semantics like a `Channel`).

### Reference-counted / demand-driven singletons

```kotlin
val getCache = WhileUsed { mutableMapOf<String, Entity>() }
val getCacheProxy = WhileUsed { getCache(it) }  // example how to access other WhileUsed values

class MainViewModel : ViewModel() {
    // The cache is created here and disposed once the ViewModel is destroyed. If multiple ViewModels use the cache
    // at the same time then one single instance is shared between all of them and freed once the last ViewModel is
    // destroyed.
    private val cache: MutableMap<String, Entity> = getCacheProxy(viewModelScope)

    fun load(id: String) = cache[id]

    fun save(id: String, value: Entity) {
        cache[id] = value
    }

    // You can even track WhileUsed (with reference counting) via derived/autoRun.
    private val entities: StateFlow<Set<Entity>> = derived { get(getCacheProxy).keys }
}
```

`WhileUsed` allows you to create an on-demand computed singleton that gets disposed as soon as nobody is using it, anymore.
This can be used to e.g. share the same cache between all ViewModels within a certain screen flow, but free up the memory as soon as the user leaves the screen flow.

As an alternative to the `CoroutineScope` based reference counting you can also pass a `DisposableGroup` or use `WhileUsed.disposableValue()`, but then you mustn't forget to explicitly call `dispose()` once the value is not needed, anymore!

This is also a nice combination with `derived`/`stateIn`/`shareIn` and `WhileSubscribed`.

Note that `autoRun`/`derived` allow resolving `WhileUsed` via `get(myWhileUsed)` like you can with `StateFlow` and this correctly tracks the reference count (important for `derived` with `WhileSubscribed`).

### Automatic cleanups based on lifecycle state

Especially on Android it's very easy to shoot yourself in the foot and e.g. have a closure that keeps a reference to a destroyed `Fragment` or mistakenly execute code on a destroyed UI.

ReactiveState provides a `Disposable` interface and most objects auto-dispose/terminate when a `CoroutineScope` or Android `Lifecycle` ends.
You can also use `disposable.disposeOnCompletionOf` to auto-dispose your disposables.
For more complex use-cases you can use `DisposableGroup` to combine (add/remove) multiple disposables into a single `Disposable` object.

With extension functions like `LifecycleOwner.onResume` or `LifecycleOwner.onStopOnce` you can easily add long-running or one-time observers to a `Lifecycle`.
These are the building blocks for your own lifecycle-aware components which can automatically clean up after themselves like `LifecycleOwner.autoRun` does.

Finally, with `validUntil()` you can define properties that only exist during a certain lifecycle subset and are dereference their value outside of that lifecycle subset.
This can get rid of the ugly [boilerplate](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding#fragments) when working with view bindings, for example.

### Flexible ViewModel instantiation

```kotlin
class MainViewModel(dependency: SomeDependency) : ViewModel() {
    // ...
}

// This ViewModel can persist state with SavedStateHandle (no more onSaveInstanceState() boilerplate)
class StateViewModel(val handle: SavedStateHandle, dependency: SomeDependency) : ViewModel() {
    // ...
}

// This is a multiplatform "ViewModel". It doesn't inherit from Android's ViewModel and doesn't depend on any Android
// code. It can still persist saved instance state via StateFlowStore (on iOS you could use an InMemoryStateFlowStore).
class MultiPlatformViewModel(
    private val scope: CoroutineScope,
    private val store: StateFlowStore,
    private val dependency: SomeDependency,
) {
    // ...
}

class MainFragment : Fragment() {
    private val viewModel by buildViewModel { MainViewModel(SomeDependency()) }
    private val viewModel2 by stateViewModel { handle -> StateViewModel(handle, SomeDependency()) }

    // With buildOnViewModel you can create an arbitrary object that lives on an internally created wrapper ViewModel
    private val multiPlatformViewModel by buildOnViewModel {
        MultiPlatformViewModel(scope, stateFlowStore, SomeDependency())
    }
}
```

ReactiveState's `buildViewModel`, `stateViewModel`, `buildOnViewModel`, and similar extension functions allow creating a `ViewModel` by directly instantiating it.
This results in more natural code and allows passing arguments to the `ViewModel` (e.g. for dependency injection).
Internally, these helper functions are simple wrappers around `viewModels`, `ViewModelProvider.Factory` and `AbstractSavedStateViewModelFactory`.
They just reduce the amount of boilerplate for common use-cases.

### StateFlowStore - StateFlow based SavedStateHandle

```kotlin
class MainViewModel(handle: SavedStateHandle) : ViewModel() {
    val store = handle.stateFlowStore(viewModelScope)
    val count: StateFlow<Int> = store.getData("count", 0)
}
```

A `StateFlowStore` provides a similar API to `SavedStateHandle`, but based on `StateFlow` instead of `LiveData`.

With `InMemoryStateFlowStore` you can do e.g. unit testing or abstract away platform differences in multiplatform projects.

On Android you'll often want `SavedStateHandleStore` to convert `SavedStateHandle` to a `StateFlowStore`. There is also a convenient extension function: `SavedStateHandle.stateFlowStore(CoroutineScope)`

In practice, you'll want to make your ViewModel testable without Robolectric using a tiny indirection:

```kotlin
class MainViewModel(createStore: (CoroutineScope) -> StateFlowStore) : ViewModel() {
    // This indirection makes it possible to unit test with InMemoryStateFlowStore instead of SavedStateHandle
    val store = createStore(viewModelScope)
    val count = store.getData("count", 0)
}

class MainFragment : Fragment() {
    private val viewModel by stateViewModel { MainViewModel(it::stateFlowStore) }

    // ...
}
```

### Error handling

```kotlin
interface MyHandlerEvents : ErrorEvents {
    fun onSomethingHappened()
}

class MyHandler {
    val eventNotifier = EventNotifier<MyHandlerEvents>()

    fun doSomething() {
        withErrorHandling(eventNotifier) {
            if (computeResult() > 5) {
                eventNotifier { onSomethingHappened() }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Since it's a common pattern, we provide `ErrorEvents` and `withErrorHandling` to automatically catch and report any errors within a code block to an `EventNotifier`.

The `ErrorEvents` interface provides a simple `onError(error: Throwable)` method.

This pattern is also useful in combination with `CoroutineLauncher` in order to automate error handling for all coroutines.

### MutableValueFlow - the more flexible alternative to MutableStateFlow

`MutableValueFlow` implements the same API as `MutableStateFlow`, but also provides an `update` method for working with mutable values:

```kotlin
// MutableValueFlow

valueFlow.update {
    it.subvalue1.deepsubvalue.somevalue += 3
    it.subvalue2.state = SomeState.IN_PROGRESS
    it.isLoading = true
}

// versus MutableStateFlow

stateFlow.value = flow.value.let {
    it.copy(
        subvalue1 = it.subvalue1.copy(
            deepsubvalue = it.subvalue1.deepsubvalue.copy(somevalue = it.subvalue1.deepsubvalue.somevalue + 3)
         ),
        subvalue2 = it.subvalue2.copy(state = SomeState.IN_PROGRESS),
        isLoading = true,
    )
}
```

If you work with immutable data classes then you might know this problem. You can make immutable data less painful with functional lenses (e.g. [arrow Optics DSL](https://arrow-kt.io/docs/optics/dsl/) and [arrow Lens](https://arrow-kt.io/docs/optics/lens/)), but that can still result in complicated and inefficient code.

On the other hand, mutable data does allow to shoot yourself in the foot. So whether you want to use `MutableValueFlow` is a question of your architecture and code structure.
Usually, reactive code consciously puts data into observables (`StateFlow`s) in order to allow for reactivity.
This results in a code structure where these `StateFlow`s are the primary hosts of each piece of data and the mutations are limited around each `StateFlow` or even around the observable database as the single source of truth.

So, under these circumstances it can be quite safe to work with mutable data and `MutableValueFlow` makes such use-cases simpler than `MutableStateFlow`.

### Unit tests with coroutines

The `CoroutineTest` base class provides some often useful helpers for working with coroutines.

```kotlin
class MyTest : CoroutineTest() {
    // This works because MainScope/Dispatchers.Main is automatically set up correctly by CoroutineTest
    val viewModel = MyViewModel()

    // Let's use a mock to test the events emitted by MyViewModel
    val events: MyEvents = mock()

    @Before
    fun setup() {
        // You can access the TestCoroutineScope directly to launch some background processing.
        // In this case, let's process MyViewModel's events.
        coroutinesTestRule.testCoroutineScope.launch {
            viewModel.eventNotifier.collect { events.it() }
        }
    }

    @Test
    fun `some test`() = runBlockingTest {
        viewModel.doSomething()
        advanceUntilIdle()
        verify(events).someEvent()
    }
}
```

This also sets up a global `dispatchers` variable which you can use in all of your code instead of passing a `CoroutineDispatcher` around as arguments:

```kotlin
// Use this instead of Dispatchers.IO. In unit tests this will automatically use
// the TestCoroutineDispatcher instead. Outside of unit tests it points to Dispatchers.IO.
// You can also define your own overrides if you want.
withContext(dispatchers.io) {
    // do some IO
}
```

If you can't derive from `CoroutineTest` directly (e.g. because you have some other base test class), you can alternatively use delegation with the `CoroutineTestRuleOwner` interface:

```kotlin
class MyTest : SomeBaseTestClass(), CoroutineTestRuleOwner by CoroutineTest() {
    @Test
    fun `some test`() = runBlockingTest {
        // ...
    }
}
```

If you want to go even lower-level there's also `CoroutineTestRule`:

```kotlin
class MyTest {
    @get:Rule
    override val coroutineTestRule = CoroutineTestRule()

    @Test
    fun `some test`() = coroutineTestRule.runBlockingTest {
        // ...
    }
}
```
